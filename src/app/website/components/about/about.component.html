        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer with more than 7 years of experience in the IT field with a great experience working
          with
          clients from different countries and different business areas, this helped me to get the flexibility to work
          in
          different environments and get the best performance.
          Personally, I feel comfortable working with a team, and I usually put forward the success of the group ahead
          of
          personal success. Even though, throughout my career, I've worked on projects being the only person in charge
          of
          it.
          I don't have a specific main area, throughout my career I've worked in different fields of the development
          cycle,
          even though, my experience is based on Front end and back end with a hard knowledge in javascript frameworks
          and
          .net stack.
          In addition, I have good soft skills, and because of that, I can help to get a balanced team and a good
          environment.
          In my professional life, I have 3 main concepts, compromise, work quality, and continuous learning, these are
          pushing me to have excellent performance and continuous improvement.
